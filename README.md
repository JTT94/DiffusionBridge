# Simulating Diffusion Bridges with Score Matching
This is a PyTorch implementation of the methodology described in the article [arXiv:2111.07243](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07243).

Run the following Python notebooks to repeat experiments for each model:
1) repeat_ou.ipynb for Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process;
2) repeat_radial.ipynb for a specific case of an interest rates model proposed by AÃ¯t-Sahalia and Lo (Journal of Finance, 1998);
3) repeat_cell.ipynb for cell differentiation and development model of Wang et al. (PNAS, 2011).
